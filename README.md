# Known bugs
- Your authorization token will eventually expire and will not automatically reset and every tab will be empty, manually log out and log back in to fix this.

# Disclaimer
- While it is very unlikely to have your account banned from using this I am not liable for any damage that happens to your account from using this app. It was made for testing out what you can do with the API.
- VRChat has some kind of API rate limit but you are unlikely to encounter it in normal usage so don't spam the programs features or it might break.
- VRChat's only stance on using their API is "Don't be malicious" ![asd](https://i.imgur.com/SAGcwo1.png "Player moderations")<br>
