# Update 22/9/2018
VRChat has implemented their own trust system and for some reason they have stepped them down by one so if you are Veteran in  this app you're only trusted in game

# Update 24/8/2018

Seems like VRChat API has stopped providing unity packages for your own content so any content uploaded after 24/8/2018 may not be able to be downloaded with this program

# VRChat Appi

VRChat Appi is an experimental desktop application that uses the VRChat API.
  - See who's online without launching the game
  - View your trust rating
  - Change your avatars name without having to reupload your entire avatar
  - Set the picture of your avatar to anything without having to spend countless minutes adjusting VRC Camera
  - Download the original unity packages of your avatars or worlds in case you lose the original files
 
# Download

Head over to the releases tab or click the link below and unzip the folder anywhere and run VRChat App.exe

#### Trust

Trust is gained by generally spending time in VRChat and currently only affects your ability to send feedback and your content upload rights. New accounts start as Untrusted and to be able to upload your own content to the game you need to reach at least Basic or higher. Ability to leave feedback is gained when you reach Neutral or higher.

The trust ratings are as follows from lowest to highest

- Untrusted
- Basic
- Neutral
- Known
- Trusted
- Veteran
- Legend


#### Badges

Hover over a badge to see what it means.



## Friends

Get an overview of your online friends and what world they are in.

## Avatars

Browse all your avatars and download them as their original unity packages or edit them. List order and how many avatars to show per page can be configured in the settings.

### Avatar editor

Enabling the program to manage and modify your VRChat account in the settings unlocks the ability for the program to edit your avatars name and image without having to reupload your avatar. While this process only takes couple seconds it can take multiple minutes for VRChat servers to process your changes.

#### Avatar image

Avatar image should be a direct link to an image in .jpg or .png format. To avoid stretching the image should have an aspect ratio of 4:3 and for best results should have a resolution of 1200x900 pixels.

## Worlds

Here you can browse and download your own worlds as their original unity packages in case you lose the original files. List order and how many worlds to list can be configured in the settings.

## Moderations

Shows your player moderations. On the right are users who you have blocked or muted and on the left are users who have blocked or muted you. Hovering over a name shows a timestamp of the action. Speaker icon indicates a mute and eye a block.

# Known bugs
- Having the program idle for extended periods of time will give you invalid credentials error. This can be fixed by logging out and logging back in or restarting the program.
- Error handling is nonexistent so if a page appears completely blank or the loading indicator is stuck it means something went wrong. Relogging may or may not fix the issue.

# Disclaimer

- While it is very unlikely to have your account banned from using this I am not liable for any damage that happens to your account from using this app. It was made for testing out what you can do with the API.
- VRChat has some kind of API rate limit but you are unlikely to encounter it in normal usage so don't spam the programs features or it might break.
- VRChat's only stance on using their API is "Don't be malicious" ![Source](https://i.imgur.com/SAGcwo1.png "Player moderations")<br>
